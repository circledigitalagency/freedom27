			"<p><strong>What is trauma?</strong></p> <p>Trauma is a disturbing experience that could have occurred during childhood, loss of life, abuse in multiple forms, relationship, work environment and many more events. It can manifest itself as an emotional, physical or psychological harm.</p> <br /> <p>Reliving our traumatic experiences without healing creates a stressful mental state, and dependency which can lead to becoming easily irritable, wondering mind, attracting the wrong people, aging faster and become more frustrated. There must be an intention to heal from the things that we experienced that are self-sabotaging. The good news is you can recover from traumatic experiences through a self-healing process.</p> <br /> <p>Here's an interesting perspective, whenever you are feeling sick, your body has identified elements that are not meant to be in your well functional structure. This leads to your body rejecting toxic components you have consumed or that have developed in order for you to get to a point where you feel better. But guess what, if your body doesnâ€™t have the capacity to heal and fight those toxins, you may die unless you seek help immediately. Same applies with your traumas, if you leave them unattended, you are at constant risk of emotional and mental death before the physical death. But if you take your conscious time to work through them, you increase your chances of enjoying the best version of yourself.</p> <br /> <p>Healing from a trauma is a journey that requires patience, self-compassion, and support. By acknowledging your traumatic experiences and working through them diligently, you can reclaim your life and build a stronger, more resilient future. Remember, you are not alone, we are with you and there are resources available to support and empower you every step of the way.</p> <br />",

			"<p>Are you tired of feeling anxious and overwhelmed? Do you struggle to manage your worries and fears? Are you uncertain about the future? You're not alone. Anxiety is a common experience that can affect anyone, regardless of their background or circumstances and it comes in different forms and types.</p> <br /> <p>Are you tired of feeling anxious and overwhelmed? Do you struggle to manage your worries and fears? Are you uncertain about the future? You're not alone. Anxiety is a common experience that can affect anyone, regardless of their background or circumstances and it comes in different forms and types. </p> <br /> <p>The potential of an undesired outcome grips us in ways that leaves us emotionally devastated and unregulated. It gives us worry and anxiety. When we grow old without achieving what we wanted, we become anxious of the future and what it holds. Our world and perspectives become chaotic.</p> <br /> <p>When you are overly anxious, you lose clarity of the present moment and are deprived of the opportunity to be yourself. Itâ€™s never too late to restart life, at whatever age you are; for as long as you are still alive you can start again.</p> <br /> <p>Tshepo Matlou found from his traumatic life experience and research that to be free is to be present. Meaning you can never fully utilise what you have now because your focus is on what you do not have or on how things could have been. The beauty of life lies not in the depression of the past or the anxiety of the future, but in the gift of the present moment.</p> <br /> <p>At Freedom 27, we understand the impact of anxiety on your life, and weâ€™re here to help. We can hold your hand to your desired freedom, clarity and confidence. We can support you and be with you every step of the way. We have personal and professional tools & frameworks that work for your unique needs. Collaborate with a partner that understands you.</p> <br /> <p><i>Freedom 27</i>, where we journey to your freedom.</p> <br />",

		blogText:
			"<p>Did you know that your depression is lying to you? Did you know that whatever situation you are going through; you have the capacity to overcome and bring life changing solutions to it?</p> <br /> <p>With lifeâ€™s struggle and suffering that is nested within human existence lies the potential for one to deteriorate into depression. This depression overly exaggerates how bad your situations and emotions are, which unfortunately lead others into committing suicide. It goes without saying that depression has its clinical diagnosis that emphasizes itâ€™s realness, and acknowledging that reality doesnâ€™t mean that the depression is the truth you should be living in.</p> <p><strong>For that depression is lying to you.</strong></p> <br /> <p>The truth is that what you feel depressed about is in the past and as real as those feelings are to you, the reality is in the past. You need to have enough self compassion to create a reality that is far and better from what depressed you. You can still live a life of purpose, meaning and fulfillment, only if you stop living in the past. Only if you stop feeling sorry for yourself and take centre stage in creating a life of freedom. There has to be an intention to forgive those who do not ask for forgiveness, to release them from our system.</p> <br /> <p>You need to have a will to fight for your freedom from your depression. Albert Einstein said Imagination is more powerful than knowledge. Make sure that the nation in your mind is positive, it speaks highly of you, continues to think about solutions for every problem you are facing. And in so doing, you have embarked on your depression - free journey and on enjoying days worth living a fulfilled life.</p> <br /> <p>Join as we embark in healing solutions which are connect to nature, through fire talks, nature hikes and connecting spaces to find mechanism to cope and survive but beyond these be Free.</p> <br /> <p>Take a step and partner with us.</p>",
